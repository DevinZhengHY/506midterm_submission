1. There are three files:
    A.  midterm_report.pdf contains the report of this midterm
    B.  feature_extraction.py are the codes where I mainly complete the extraction, since my .ipynb notebook is directly using the datasets after executing feature_extraction.
    C.  Midterm.ipynb notebook contains all the code of my work, and besides basic codes, I made docstring at the beginning of each kernel. 


2. Please contact zhaoyu@bu.edu if something is missing. Thank you!
